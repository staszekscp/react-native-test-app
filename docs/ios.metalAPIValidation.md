The API Validation layer checks for code that calls the Metal API incorrectly,
including errors in creating resources, encoding Metal commands, and performing
other common tasks.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The API validation layer has a small, but measureable, impact on CPU
> performance.

[Validating your app’s Metal API usage](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/validating-your-apps-metal-api-usage/).
